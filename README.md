# My docker-compose files

This is my Docker-Compose file. Took me ages to create but quite happy where I am at the moment. 

Have a look at files and let me know if you have any questions. I once have been completely new to docker-compose so undestand that it might sometimes be quite overwhelming

## TO-DO
- [ ] Complete description of what containers I use and why
- [ ] create a bidge for zerotier
- [ ] start using influx db and grafana
- [ ] find something similar to glaucamole that works with Windows 10
